- efficient compiling (not take minutes to compile a code when you want to test)
- efficient execution
- easy to code

- strong, static type system (everything has a type)
- C inspired syntax
- compiled (we need to compile the code to execute)
- multi paradigm (object oriented, struct programming, imperative programming. It all up to you)
- garbage collected (process that deletes data that not using anymore. No one is pointing at memory space, so it's deleted)
- creates a single binary compilation (when compile, creates one file. One executable output for code)
- new versions will be always fully backwards compatible(new version is compatible with the previous versions..).


- every file must be within a package(folder)
- the project must contains an entry point, where the code will init and run (package main and function main)


- it can generate executable binary files for different platforms and operating systems
    - it can compile to WebAssembly (WASM, is ability of the web platform, like browsers, to execute native code that can be written from differents languages)
        Ex: games, criptocurrencies, Artificial inteligence
    - it can transpile to frontend javascript (GopherJS)
- multi platform (creating app for a platform, need to pick both DOS and the architecture)

- Go (Golang) GOOS and GOARCH https://gist.github.com/asukakenji/f15ba7e588ac42795f421b48b8aede63

Language types

    Interpreted Languages --> Source Code (javascript, python..)

    Intermediate Compiled Languages --> Bytecode (Java, C#)

    Compiled languages --> Machine Code (code execute directly in one CPU)


syntax

    Code blocks in {}
    No styling freedom
    does not need semi-colon (;) unless you need. To separate sentences
        Ex: print("hello"); print("another print in the same line")
    Case sensitive language
    Strongly typed
    No object oriented

Rules

    One file act as the entry point with a main function

    folder is a package (pasta Ã© um pacote)

    within a file
        Variables
        functions
        Type declarations
        Methods declarations

Modules and CLI

    Module is a project! is a group of packages
    it contains go.mod file with configuration and metadata

    CLI manipulates the module
        go mod init
        go build
        go run 
        go test
        go get


Workspaces and CLI

    is a new kind of super module app

    it contains a go.work file with configuration and metadata including which module to use

    CLI manipulates the workspaces

        go work init

    workspaces--
        modules--
            packages--


Data types goes after identifier
Variables have nil by default
Constants can be only bool, string or numbers

Immutable variable x constant

    Immutable variable is a varible, so it is an a space alocate in memory
    immutable was set and no one can not change the value

    constant: The compiler finds a constant reference, it goes to the definition copy the value and paste the value
    "copy and paste"
    it's not in a memoty, it is a fix value

variable with initialization
    var name string
    name = "John"

or

initialization shortcut 
    otherName := "Mike"


Types
    string
    numbers values: int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
        uint - unsigned int - only positive numbers
    floating values: float32, float64
    bool
        == != < > <= >= && || !
    pointers
        pointer is we have a variable, and then we have another variable that is pointing to the original one.


    
    numbers

        id := 4
        price := 45.4

        priceAsInt := int(price)
        idAsFloat := float32(id)


    Strings

        str1 := "Just a text"

        str2 := "Every text
            is multiline
            by default"


    Collections

        Arrays: fixed length
            [5]int

        Slices: similar to a dynamic length array,
        but they are actually chunck of arrays
            []int

        Maps: key/value dictionaries
            map[keytype]valuetype

        Generics

Visibility
    variables, constants, functions..

    if it's camelCase = private to the package

        func notExported() {}

    if it's TitleCase = public and exported to others packages

        func Exported() {}

Variables and lambda functions can be:

    - Module Scoped
    - Function Scoped
    - Block Scoped

Functions
    
    - It can receive arguments
    - arguments can have default values
    - in Go, functions can return more than one value
    - can return labeled(rotulado) variables
    - receive arguments always by value
        pass arguments as copy
        when pass a value as an argument, it not pass
        the reference to the variable that has the value
        you are cloning the value, a copy of the value
    
    Functions receiving references

        receive pointer instead of the value

        func increment (x *int) {
            *x++
        }

        func main() {
            i := 1
            increment(&i)
        }

Control structeres

    if - else

        if user != nil {
        } else {
        }

        you can create variables that will be just used inside the if scope
        first expression - variable (message)
        second expression - condition (user != nil)

        if message := "hello"; user != nil {
        } else {
        }

    switch (reloaded)

        switch day {

            case "Monday":
                fmt.Println("It's Monday")
            case "Saturday":
                fmt.Println("It's Saturday")
            case "Sunday":
                fmt.Println("It's Sunday")
            default:
                fmt.Println("It's another day")
        }

        switch with any condition with any variable
        ex: can be used to verify parameters when the backend receive datas
        switch {

            case user != nil:
                ..
            case user.active == false:
                ..
            case user.deleted == true:
                ..
            default:
        }

    for

        for i:=0; i<len(collection); i++ {
        }

        for range, similar to "for in" in JS
        for index := range collection {
        }

        for range, similar to "foreach"
        for key, value := range map {
        }

        endGame := false
        for endGame {
            // process game loop
            // like while
        }

        for count < 10 {
            count += 1;
        }

        for {
            // infinite loop
        }


compiler

    does not matter for the compiler the name of the go files
    what matters is the name of the package

Conversion to string

    use fmt.Sprintf to make a custom string, it will return a string
    like when you want to send a string customized

    ex:
    fmt.Sprintf("%.2f", value) // value will print just 2 decimal after the comma
    fmt.Sprintf("Hello %v how are you doing this %v?", name, day)


Type definition

    // type alias
    type definition = float32

    // new type based on
    type distance float32

    // types have a constructor and conversion functions
    d := distance(34.5)

    METHOD X FUNCTION

    // Function - just receive argument, or not, and does not hava attribute argument
    func ToKm(miles distance) distanceKm {
        return distanceKm(1.60934 * miles)
    }

    // Method - has an attribute argument
    func (miles distance) ToKm() distanceKm {
        return distanceKm(1.60934 * miles)
    }


Complex types for definitions

    Structures
        - kind replace the class idea
        - data type with strongly typed properties
        - have default constructor
        - can be added methods to it

    Interfaces
        - definition of methods
        - emulate polimorsphism
        - implicit implementation
        - can embed interfaces in other interfaces

GoRoutines

    go way of using threads
    invoke any function with a go prefix
        go func whatever()

    can communicate through channels, an special
    type of variable

    A channel contains a value of any kind

    A routine can define a value for a channel
    and other routine can wait for that value

    Channels can buffered or not

    Using Channels:
    
    Ex 1:
        var m1 chan string

        m2 := make(chan string)

        m2 <- "hello"

        messagem := <- m2

    Ex 2 (buffer channel):
        // 2 - how many of those values you wanna send over the channel
        logs := make(chan string, 2)
        // sending two messages
        logs <- "hello"
        logs <- "world"
        fmt.Println(<-messages)
        fmt.Println(<-messages)

    Channel has two goals:
        
        1. send and receive data between GoRoutines
        2. use it for one routine to wait for another routine
            it's kind of an event listener between goroutines

    TO AVOID DEADLOCKS:
        close the channels before ending the program with close(chan)

closures functions 
    nested function that allows us to access variables of the outer function even after the outer function is closed.

    package main
    import "fmt"

    // outer function
    func greet() func() string {

        // variable defined outside the inner function
        name := "John"
        
        // return a nested anonymous function
        return func() string {
            name = "Hi " + name
            return name
        }

    }

    func main() {

        // call the outer function
        message := greet()

        // call the inner function
        fmt.Println(message())
    }

    Output: Hi John


Testing

    - A test is a file with suffix _test.go
    - Put the file in the same folder in your package
    - define functions with prefix Test and with an special
        signature receiving a *testing.T argument
    - The function inside calls methods of T
    - you can create subtests as goroutines
    - can use CLI with go test
    - TableDrivenTest Design Pattern
    - Fuzzing
        Automated testing that manipulates inputs to find bugs.
        Go fuzzing user coverage guidance to find failures and is valuable
        in detecting security exploits and vulnetabilities

Go Templates
    
    - use to create server-side rendering
    - HTML file with go code
    - it is in the html/package package
    - can include expressions in {{}}
    - Trimming spaces available
    - actions and pipelines
    - if else conditions
    - range for loops
    - call functions
     
Compiling

    - Compiling the project
        go build .

    - Compiling in one specific output folder
        go build . -o build/

    - Compiling for other platforms and OSs
        env GOOS=target-OS
        GOARCH=target-architecture go build .

    - Compile and install
        go install .

Packaging

    - Go produces a binary
    - It does not provide any packaging solution
    - if want to embed assets (like .png .js ..) for an
        app, it need to use third-party or OSs tools, such as:

            - installers for Windows
            - DMG package for MacOs
            - RPM or DEB packages for Linux
